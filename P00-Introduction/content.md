title: "React Redux Timers - Introduction"
slug: react-redux-timers-introduction
---

The goal of the project is create a web app that stores list of timers.
Timers will keep track of elapsed time. It could be used to track time for billing clients, scientific processes, or other uses. Through building this app, you will learn how to use React to manage views, and Redux to manage application state.

While not a complete product, this app has many features that allow you to learn more about JavaScript, React and Redux. It also provides an opportunity to learn more about vanilla JavaScript and takes a close look at the Date Object.

The app created in this tutorial could be the basis of a real world
product like [Toggl.com](http://toggl.com)!

# User Stories

**TBD**

# Using Git/GitHub

Much like we've done in earlier tutorials, make sure you're committing your code as you complete milestones. At a minimum, you should make a commit whenever the tutorial prompts you.

# Set Up Git/GitHub

Set up your repo!

>[action]
> Make your first commit
>
```bash
$ git init
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'project init'
```

Now go to GitHub and create a public repository, and now associate it as a remote for your local git project and then push to it.

>[action]
> Push it!
>
```bash
$ git remote add origin GITHUB-REPO-URL
$ git push origin master -u
```
