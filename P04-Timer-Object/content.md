# Defining the Timer Object

The app will create and store Objects that define a timer. 
Timer objects will have properties that define the timer. 
These will be: 

 - name: String - the name of the timer
 - time: Number - the time in milliseconds
 - isRunning: Boolean - tracks whether the timer is running or paused
 
 You could more properties to expand the functionality of the app. 
 For example you might have billable, and rate if the app was used 
 for business. 
 
 JavaScript only hase one Object type. It has many ways to create 
 objects. For this tutorial I'm going to suggest using the class
 syntax. This will follow the same coding style used for creating 
 React components. 

## Challenges 

Define a class 'Timer'. 

The Timer class should define the following properties: 

- name
- time
- isRunning
