[Redux](https://redux.js.org/) is a tool for managing application state. Redux is based on the [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/) pattern developed by Facebook, which imposes a unidirectional data flow.

*Redux is a JavaScript implementation of Flux,* and while Redux stands on it's own,
it is often used with React.

This happens so often, that there now exists a library that integrates Redux with React called **React-Redux**.
