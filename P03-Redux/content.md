# Redux

Redux is a tool for managing application state. Redux is based on the 
Flux pattern developped by Facebook. 

The Flux pattern imposes a unidirectional data flow. Redux is a 
JavaScript implementation of Flux. While Redux stands on it's own 
it is often used with React. So often that there is a library that 
integrates Redux with React called React-Redux.
